= Future Plans =

* TinyMCE Integration - Waiting on WP 3.9 (TinyMCE v4)
 * Buttons to create/edit the include shortcode
 * Have the editor display included content, and update included pages on save
* Add button/modal like "Add Media" to generate shortcodes for the user and place them in the editor
